My whole being exists in a formless void.  My senses are idle.  My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct.  In short, my program writes itself.  True, sometimes there are difficult problems.  I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently.  Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke.  I then compile the program.  I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being.  I close my eyes for a moment and then log off.\"",
